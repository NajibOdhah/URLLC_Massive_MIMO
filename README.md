# URLLC with Massive MIMO
This repository contains the matlab numerical routines to obtain the kind of figures showed in the paper:

J. Östman, A. Lancho, G. Durisi and L. Sanguinetti "URLLC with Massive MIMO: Analysis and Design at Finite Blocklength", Johan Östman, Alejandro Lancho, Giuseppe Durisi and Luca Sanguinetti, IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., to appear. 

Please, cite the aforementioned paper when using the code. 

## Content of the repository

This repository contains three folders corresponding to the sections of the paper where the figures appear. The main files to generate each figure are named as "sectionX_figX.m". Aditional required files are also provided. 

Some of the auxiliary matlab files used in these routines has been taken from the github repository "https://github.com/emilbjornson/massivemimobook". Specifically, the following files: 
  
  - functionChannelEstimates.m
  - functionCombinerPrecoder.m
  - functionExampleSetup.m
  - functionRlocalscattering.m
